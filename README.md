<br> <br>

On choosing the character, the user can move it using the WASD keys, respectively for up, left, down and right, and pressing the space key increases the speed of the character.

The motive of the game is to save the character, as well as keep atleast one prey and one predator in the wildlife reserve. If there are no preys or predators, the ecological balance of the reserve gets destroyed and the game is lost.

On regular intervals, Informations regarding wildlife reserve, good bio-diversity practises and other useful information keeps flashing on the screen for the benefit of user and social good.
